## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, we will use what we've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then try out our model on images of German traffic signs that we find on the web.

Here's the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/agoila/udacity-carnd-P2/blob/master/LeNet_Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) for this project. The HTML file is available [here](https://github.com/agoila/udacity-carnd-P2/blob/master/report.html)

Check out the my [writeup](https://github.com/agoila/udacity-carnd-P2/blob/master/Writeup-P2.md) for this project. The images downloaded from the web can be found [here](https://github.com/agoila/udacity-carnd-P2/tree/master/examples) as *test1.jpg, test2.jpg* etc.

The TensorBoard logdir is located [here](https://github.com/agoila/udacity-carnd-P2/tree/master/logs/train/1). To run TensorBoard from your command prompt, just type:

`tensorboard --logdir="./logs/train/1"`

The writeup has been written following the guidelines [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view).

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
